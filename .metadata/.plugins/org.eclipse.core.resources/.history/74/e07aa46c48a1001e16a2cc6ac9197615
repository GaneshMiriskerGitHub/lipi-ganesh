/*
 * Lipi kosam Notes :
 * 
 * Generally, 
 * Service    ki -> ServiceImpl
 * Repository ki -> RepositoryImpl
 * DAO        ki -> DAOImpl
 * "This is Good practice"
 * 
 * 
 * Similarly, For Functional "Interface" we can give its own Impl "class"
 * "This is bad practice"
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * If there is a functional interface ,
 * you can provide implementation of the unimplemented method 
 * by creating Impl class  "This is bad practice"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Q) What is Good Practice ?
 *    "pullalu pettali" ->
 *    So Whenever you want to provide implementation of functional interfaces
 *    use Lambda expressions
